# Description
# 
# Many patches don't apply but can easily be reapplied by using git's very
# powerful merge tools. This script finds the last commit that the patch
# applied to, makes a temporary commit and then tries to merge against the
# given branch.
#
# Usage:
#
# 1) Checkout the branch you want to reapply the patch to.
# 2) run reapply.sh https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/foobar.patch origin/8.x
# 3) git diff origin/8.x > new.patch
#

BRANCH="$2"

wget $PATCH -O tmp.patch
# Get a branch to work in.
git branch -D reapply
git checkout -b reapply
git reset --hard $BRANCH

# Find the last commit the patch applies to.
